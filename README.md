# kanban

Durable, local-first work state for long-horizon agents and swarms.

Kanban is not primarily a board UI. It is an **agent-work ledger** designed
around one failure condition: an agent may disappear at any token boundary,
and a replacement must be able to resume safely without conversation history.

SQLite is authoritative. Plans, progress, evidence, decisions, claims, and
checkpoints survive sessions and process restarts. A generated `TODO.md` is a
human-readable projection, not a competing state store.

## Why

Chat history is volatile coordination state. It becomes incomplete during
context compaction, provider failure, rate limiting, model swaps, and swarm
fan-out. Kanban moves the minimum safe handoff contract out of chat:

- atomic task claims with expiring leases;
- dependency-aware pull scheduling;
- append-only plan, progress, blocker, decision, and evidence notes;
- structured checkpoints containing intent, next action, validations, and
  repository state;
- bounded cold-start context for the next model turn;
- workspace state outside managed product repositories.

## Quick start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
bun install
bun link

cd /path/to/project
kanban init --name my-project
kanban task add "Implement durable resume" --id t-resume --priority 1

kanban claim t-resume --as deepseek --session turn-1 --json
# Save the returned leaseToken.

kanban note t-resume "Inspect persistence and restart behavior" \
  --as deepseek --kind plan

kanban checkpoint t-resume \
  --lease "$LEASE_TOKEN" \
  --as deepseek \
  --session turn-1 \
  --summary "Mapped the current persistence boundary" \
  --intent "Implement restart-safe checkpoints before orchestration" \
  --next-action "Add the recovery test" \
  --validation "schema migration passes" \
  --repo "$PWD" --branch main --head abc123

# A fresh agent needs only this plus the repository:
kanban context t-resume
```

Use `kanban claim --next --as <agent>` for pull-based swarms. A second worker
cannot claim the same task while its lease is live. If a worker disappears,
the lease expires and the task becomes claimable again; the last durable
checkpoint remains available.

## Long-horizon loop

An orchestrator should run fresh, bounded model turns instead of depending on
one ever-growing conversation:

```text
claim task
  -> load `kanban context`
  -> work for one bounded turn
  -> append notes and write a checkpoint
  -> CONTINUE | BLOCKED | DONE
  -> start another fresh turn when CONTINUE
```

`blocked` and `done` checkpoints atomically update the task and release its
lease. A `continue` checkpoint retains the lease.

## Storage and privacy

`kanban init` registers the current workspace in an operator-private registry:

```text
${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/kanban/
  registry.db
  boards/<uuid>.db
```

No state is written into the managed repository. Override discovery with
`KANBAN_DATA_DIR`, `KANBAN_DB`, or `--db PATH`. This permits atmux to retain
per-team databases while orch and other harnesses share the same API.

SQLite runs in WAL mode with foreign keys and a five-second busy timeout.
Mutations use prepared statements and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` where ownership is
decided. Agents should use the typed library or CLI; arbitrary write SQL is
not part of the public contract.

## Current scope

Version 0.1 is the substrate and CLI vertical slice. Planned adapters:

1. opencode-plugin-orch long-horizon workflow;
2. atmux compatibility adapter and migration path;
3. MCP surface for other compatible harnesses;
4. optional board UI and cross-host synchronization.

Integration handoffs: [orch](docs/integrating-orch.md) and
[atmux](docs/integrating-atmux.md).

See [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-durable-agent-work-ledger.md) for the decisions
and migration strategy.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

The database migration ladder is append-only. Never edit a released migration;
add the next rung.
