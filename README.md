# kanban

Durable, local-first work state for long-horizon agents and swarms.

Kanban is an operator-private personal work system across projects and Git
worktrees. It is not a shared team issue tracker.

Kanban is not primarily a board UI. It is an **agent-work ledger** designed
around one failure condition: an agent may disappear at any token boundary,
and a replacement must be able to resume safely without conversation history.

SQLite is authoritative. Plans, progress, evidence, decisions, claims, and
checkpoints survive sessions and process restarts. A generated `TODO.md` is a
human-readable projection, not a competing state store.

## Why

Chat history is volatile coordination state. It becomes incomplete during
context compaction, provider failure, rate limiting, model swaps, and swarm
fan-out. Kanban moves the minimum safe handoff contract out of chat:

- atomic task claims with expiring leases;
- dependency-aware pull scheduling;
- append-only plan, progress, blocker, decision, and evidence notes;
- structured checkpoints containing intent, next action, validations, and
  repository state;
- transactional token-pressure handoffs between outgoing and replacement
  agents;
- bounded cold-start context for the next model turn;
- workspace state outside managed product repositories.

## Quick start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
bun install
bun link

cd /path/to/project
kanban init --name my-project
kanban task add "Implement durable resume" --id t-resume --priority 1

kanban claim t-resume --as deepseek --session turn-1 --json
# Save the returned leaseToken.

kanban note t-resume "Inspect persistence and restart behavior" \
  --as deepseek --kind plan

kanban checkpoint t-resume \
  --lease "$LEASE_TOKEN" \
  --as deepseek \
  --session turn-1 \
  --summary "Mapped the current persistence boundary" \
  --intent "Implement restart-safe checkpoints before orchestration" \
  --next-action "Add the recovery test" \
  --validation "schema migration passes" \
  --repo "$PWD" --branch main --head abc123

# A fresh agent needs only this plus the repository:
kanban context t-resume
```

Use `kanban claim --next --as <agent>` for pull-based swarms. A second worker
cannot claim the same task while its lease is live. If a worker disappears,
the lease expires and the task becomes claimable again; the last durable
checkpoint remains available.

## Long-horizon loop

An orchestrator should run fresh, bounded model turns instead of depending on
one ever-growing conversation:

```text
claim task
  -> load `kanban context`
  -> work for one bounded turn
  -> append notes and write a checkpoint
  -> CONTINUE | BLOCKED | DONE
  -> start another fresh turn when CONTINUE
```

`blocked` and `done` checkpoints atomically update the task and release its
lease. A `continue` checkpoint retains the lease.

When a model turn is ending, transfer ownership through Kanban itself:

```bash
kanban handoff create t-resume \
  --lease "$LEASE_TOKEN" --as outgoing-agent --reason token_pressure \
  --summary "Implemented the schema" \
  --intent "Keep the migration append-only" \
  --next-action "Run the importer contract test"

kanban handoff list --status pending --json
kanban handoff accept h-12345678 --as incoming-agent --json
kanban context t-resume
```

## Storage and privacy

`kanban init` registers the current workspace in an operator-private registry:

```text
${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/kanban/
  registry.db
  boards/<uuid>.db
```

No state is written into the managed repository. Override discovery with
`KANBAN_DATA_DIR`, `KANBAN_DB`, or `--db PATH`. This permits atmux to retain
per-team databases while orch and other harnesses share the same API.

Initialize a project once, then attach additional Git worktrees to the same
board:

```bash
kanban init --name my-project --workspace /path/to/main-worktree
cd /path/to/another-worktree
kanban workspace attach --to /path/to/main-worktree
kanban dashboard
```

SQLite runs in WAL mode with foreign keys and a five-second busy timeout.
Mutations use prepared statements and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` where ownership is
decided. Agents should use the typed library or CLI; arbitrary write SQL is
not part of the public contract.

The registry directory is mode `0700`; database files and snapshots are mode
`0600`. Check and back up all registered boards with:

```bash
kanban doctor
kanban backup --json
```

Import an existing atmux board into the currently registered project without
writing to the source database:

```bash
kanban import atmux-sqlite /path/to/.atmux/state.db --as operator --json
```

Epics, stories, tasks, hierarchy, stable IDs, timestamps, routing fields,
notes, and unknown extension JSON are preserved. Dangling historical
relationships are retained as warning metadata rather than inserted as invalid
foreign-key edges.

## Current scope

Version 0.2 is the installed private multi-project CLI and continuity slice.
It includes worktree aliases, aggregate dashboard reads, lane-aware claims,
structured handoffs, integrity checks, snapshots, and legacy atmux task import.
Planned adapters:

1. opencode-plugin-orch long-horizon workflow;
2. atmux feature parity, state importer, compatibility adapter, and verified
   removal of atmux's duplicate Kanban implementation;
3. MCP surface for other compatible harnesses;
4. optional board UI and cross-host synchronization.

Integration handoffs: [orch](docs/integrating-orch.md) and
[atmux](docs/integrating-atmux.md).

[ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-durable-agent-work-ledger.md),
[ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-private-multi-project-personal-work-system.md), and

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

The database migration ladder is append-only. Never edit a released migration;
add the next rung.
