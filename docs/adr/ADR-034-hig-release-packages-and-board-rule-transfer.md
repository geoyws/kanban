# ADR-034: HIG release packages and explicit board-rule transfer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-03
**Deciders:** Team

## Context

The release path needs a deterministic package that is built on `hax`, carries an explicit ordered install-target set for `hax` and `hig`, and includes all five Rust executables. Rule movement also needs a safe, auditable path between registries without mutating source rules in place.

## Decision

Release packaging now builds all five release executables with `cargo build --release --locked --bins`, writes a manifest with the source commit and canonical ordered `targets: ["hax","hig"]` compatibility set, binary hashes, and byte sizes, and refuses installation until the full package validates against the requested install host. HAX activation publishes a canonical receipt under the HAX install root only after activation succeeds; repeated activation of the same release ID must not rewrite that receipt with different bytes. HIG installation stages the package remotely, derives the expected HAX activation receipt from the HAX install root and release ID, validates the staged contents and canonical HAX release tree, and then updates the public binaries to traverse the install root's `current/<binary>` indirection before atomically advancing `current`. If activation fails after `current` moves, rollback restores the previous `current` target and removes the newly created release tree and receipt.

The release script itself is intended to ship as an executable shell script with mode `0755`. `package` is HAX-only; `install` and `rollback` accept `hax` and `hig`.

Registry rule transfer is now explicit:

- `rule export --board ... --as ACTOR` writes a deterministic bundle for an allowlisted set of source boards.
- `rule import PATH --as ACTOR` imports that bundle into a destination registry with fresh destination rule IDs.
- Both sides refuse missing, unregistered, unreadable, duplicate, or out-of-scope boards.
- Imports preserve body, author, timestamps, and tags, but do not mutate source rules.

## Consequences

Release artifacts are auditable and reproducible across hosts, and a partial package cannot become live. Public executable paths stay stable because they always traverse the `current` pointer, failed activations do not count toward release retention, HAX authorization evidence is canonical and append-only for each release ID, and rule movement is now idempotent and traceable by source fingerprint instead of relying on in-place consolidation.
